# LinkedList

This is a custom implementation of a linked list to test whether an optimiser can
improve a class. There are a few extra pieces of information that can improve linked-list
algorithms. 

## AddNode

If we had a `tail` attribute, then it would be a lot faster to navigate to the end to 
a linked list to append values.

## SearchList

This is pretty much optimal, since we always run the risk of `n` cost when searching through
a linked list. (parallelisation could speed it up if we stored intermediate nodes).

## ReverseList
