# PRIMES

## IsPrime

Returns true if the value is prime. 

- Reduce the max value of the loop to the sqrt of `n`

## SumPrimes

Sums the primes values up to `n`. Calls `IsPrime` for each
value. This is a very inefficient solution.

- Compute primes up to `n` with a sieve.

## PrimeFactors

Computes prime factors of n.

- Use a sieve.
